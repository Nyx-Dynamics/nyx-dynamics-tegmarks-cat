## 🧠 Summary

This model demonstrates that spatial geometry—specifically, Fibonacci scaling—preserves quantum coherence in neural microtubules under inflammatory stress. Simulations show coherence retention advantages up to 10¹⁶×, diverging sharply from classical exponential decoherence (Tegmark, 2000).
